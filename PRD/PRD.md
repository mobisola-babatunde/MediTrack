## Research and Insights

### User Research: 

**Methods:** Surveys, interviews, and focus groups with chronic patients, healthcare and providers, 

**Findings:** The majority of chronic patients struggle with medication adherence due to forgetfulness, complex regimens, and a lack of support in managing their regimens. Many users are not aware of any digital solution to help them adhere to their medication due to their low tech savviness and lack of awareness, those that are aware expressed frustration with current solutions, citing not user-friendly user experience, while healthcare providers want to be able to track their patient’s adherence to their medication. 

### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD):

**Patients:**
- Allow me to set up my medication schedule without complexity.
- Help me remember to take my medication as prescribed.
- Help me track my medication adherence to see my progress.
Healthcare Providers:
- Help me track my patients' adherence to improve their treatment outcomes.
- Provide me with insights into my patients’ medication habits to enhance their care plans.

### Market Research:
**Growth:** The medication adherence app market is expanding, driven by the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases and the shift towards digital health solutions.

**Competitor Analysis:** While top competitors offer basic features such as medication reminders and tracking, they fall short in providing a user-friendly experience that appeals to a broader audience. This presents an opportunity to differentiate by focusing on simplicity and usability, especially for less tech-savvy users.

## User Personas and Use Cases
